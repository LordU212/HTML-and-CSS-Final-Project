    <h2>Always Watch Player Stats</h2>
    <p>There is a lot of noise in NBA data. We have tons of advanced information at our disposal, which can prove daunting to interpret. The NBA's player tracking data relies on a sophisticated series of cameras affixed to the catwalks of arenas in order to produce an awesome array of numbers for us to peruse. I like leveraging statistical categories like touches into fantasy decisions, which helps reveal who has the ball in their hand the most. Clearly, point guards will surface at the top of this index, but we can also sort by different positions and in the post and paint to reveal opportunity rates.<br>

        <br>Most helpful in the tracking data might be rebounding opportunities, listed as "chances" by the league's information index. This stat is simply defined as the number of times a player is within 3.5 feet of a rebound per game.<br>
        
        <br>Last season, we saw rookie John Collins, who had hit the waiver wire in many leagues thanks to inconsistent playing time , earn an elite rebounding opportunity rate after the break. Collins ranked just ahead of LaMarcus Aldridge and just behind Clint Capela with 16.3 rebounding chances per game during this successful sample. By simply sifting through some of these opportunity stats the league provides, you can gain an actionable edge over your opponents.
    
        <br><br>As the samples grow this season, make sure to check out the leader boards in these opportunity rates for a savvy way to sift through promising players.

        Another reliable resource is our own advanced arsenal of NBA numbers available to Insiders. I namely rely on usage rate and VA (value added) for identifying players. Usage rate is the measure of team plays a player consumes while on the court -- so players who are involved with the conclusion of a possession via shots, turnovers, free throws and assists will earn gaudy usage percentages. It's not surprising then to see the Rockets' James Harden atop the leader board last season. Russell Westbrook mimics Michael Jordan's Space Jam usage, as he has led led the league in usage in four of the past five campaigns (finishing second last season). <br><br><cite> Retrieved from http://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/20704253/top-tips-winning-fantasy-basketball-season-fantasy-basketball</cite>

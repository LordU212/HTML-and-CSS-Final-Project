    <h2>Keep an eye on the waiver wire</h2>
    <p>Several top-50 commodities are likely floating in fantasy free agency in most leagues after the draft. We don't know who they are just yet -- if you do, please let us know -- but the aggressive and proactive manager has the best chance at acquiring these emergent assets. The crowd is likely already woke -- as the kids say -- to the likes of Dunn's promising role in Chicago, but when we see some newer names explode in preseason play, the intent is to audition these and other rising players via the end of your bench.<br>

        <br>This isn't to say you should cut your depth at will, but afford late-round picks a short leash when it comes to evaluating the opportunity cost during the pivotal early weeks when NBA rotations reveal a great deal of new information. Preseason trends can inform us only so much, as meaningful injuries and rotation shifts occur almost every day in this busy league. We tend to prove too loyal to our late-round picks in all fantasy formats, but this tendency can prove costly in the ever-shifting NBA landscape.<br>
        
        <br>Not that long ago, guys like Utah's Rudy Gobert and Miami's Hassan Whiteside were early-season waiver additions, so there is precedent every autumn for sourcing season-shifting commodities. We honestly don't yet know who the pivotal pickups are yet, but a willingness to leverage roster spots via fantasy free agency in the early weeks can prove profitable.<br><br> <cite> Retrieved from http://www.espn.com/fantasy/basketball/story/_/id/20704253/top-tips-winning-fantasy-basketball-season-fantasy-basketball</cite></p>
